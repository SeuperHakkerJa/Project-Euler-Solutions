# Problem: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two
#          3-digit numbers.
#
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is
# 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

'''
1. check from 999 x 999 to 100 x 100 get the first palindrome
######## however this is wrong, just like 4x4 is larger than 5x3 while program
######## stop at 5x3 first
## 1* find the max through all these calcs
2. brute force?
3. isPalindrom
'''
